                      <b class="doubleQuote">&ldquo;</b><b class="firstWord"> Solar Heaters </b>is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity
                        by the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical phenomenon.
                        It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such
                        as current, voltage, or resistance, vary when exposed to light. Individual solar cell devices
                        are often the electrical building blocks of photovoltaic modules, known colloquially as solar
                        panels. The common single junction silicon solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage
                        of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.
                        Solar cells are described as being photovoltaic, irrespective of whether the source is sunlight
                        or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a photodetector
                        (for example infrared detectors), detecting light or other electromagnetic radiation near the
                        visible range, or measuring light intensity.
                        The operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:
                        </p>
                        <div class="listing">
                        <ul>
                          <li>  1. The absorption of light, generating either electron-hole pairs or excitons.</li>

                            <li>2. The separation of charge carriers of opposite types.</li>

                            <li>3. The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p class="info">
                    In contrast, a solar thermal collector supplies heat by absorbing sunlight, for the purpose of
                    either direct heating or indirect electrical power generation from heat. A "photoelectrolytic cell"
                    (photoelectrochemical cell), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like
                    that developed by Edmond Becquerel and modern dye-sensitized solar cells), or to a device that
                    splits water directly into hydrogen and oxygen using only solar illumination.
                    Assemblies of solar cells are used to make solar modules that generate electrical power from
                    sunlight, as distinguished from a "solar thermal module" or "solar hot water panel". A solar array
                    generates solar power using solar energy.
                    Solar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the
                    Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the primary battery power source. By
                    adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to
                    the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched Explorer 6, featuring large
                    wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of
                    9600 Hoffman solar cells.

                    By the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting
                    satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best power-to-weight
                    ratio. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could
                    be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best
                    possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells
                    up until the National Science Foundation "Research Applied to National Needs" program began to push
                    development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.

                    In the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology
                    used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to gallium arsenide-based
                    III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V multijunction photovoltaic
                    cell used on spacecraft.

                    In recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and
                    highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells
                    that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar
                    cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some
                    newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed
                    of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's
                    energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity.
                    These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle
                    the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites
                    consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded
                    into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use
                    flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume.
                    The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of
                    launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a
                    launch vehicle.

                        he type, complexity and size of a solar water heating system is mostly determined by:

                        The minimum requirements of the system are typically determined by the amount or temperature of hot water required during winter, when a system's output and incoming water temperature are typically at their lowest.

                      Freeze protection measures prevent damage to the system due to the expansion of freezing transfer fluid. Drainback systems drain the transfer fluid from the system when the pump stops. Many indirect systems use antifreeze (e.g., propylene glycol) in the heat transfer fluid.
                      In some direct systems, collectors can be manually drained when freezing is expected. This approach is common in climates where freezing temperatures do not occur often, but can be less reliable than an automatic system as it relies on an operator.
                      A third type of freeze protection is freeze-tolerance, where low pressure water pipes made of silicone rubber simply expand on freezing. One such collector now has European Solar Keymark accreditation.

                    <b class="doubleQuote">&ldquo;</b><b class="firstWord">Overheat protection</b>
                    When no hot water has been used for a day or two, the fluid in the collectors and storage can reach high temperatures in all non-drainback systems. When the storage tank in a drainback system reaches its desired temperature, the pumps stop, ending the heating process and thus preventing the storage tank from overheating.
                    Some active systems deliberately cool the water in the storage tank by circulating hot water through the collector at times when there is little sunlight or at night, losing heat. This is most effective in direct or thermal store plumbing and is virtually ineffective in systems that use evacuated tube collectors, due to their superior insulation. Any collector type may still overheat. High pressure, sealed solar thermal systems ultimately rely on the operation of temperature and pressure relief valves. Low pressure, open vented heaters have simpler, more reliable safety controls, typically an open vent.

                    Simple designs include a simple glass-topped insulated box with a flat solar absorber made of sheet metal, attached to copper heat exchanger pipes and dark-colored, or a set of metal tubes surrounded by an evacuated (near vacuum) glass cylinder. In industrial cases a parabolic mirror can concentrate sunlight on the tube. Heat is stored in a hot water storage tank. The volume of this tank needs to be larger with solar heating systems to compensate for bad weather and because the optimum final temperature for the solar collector[ is lower than a typical immersion or combustion heater. The heat transfer fluid (HTF) for the absorber may be water, but more commonly (at least in active systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing anti-freeze and a corrosion inhibitor delivers heat to the tank through a heat exchanger (commonly a coil of copper heat exchanger tubing within the tank). Copper is an important component in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of its high heat conductivity, atmospheric and water corrosion resistance, sealing and joining by soldering and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks).
                    Another lower-maintenance concept is the 'drain-back'. No anti-freeze is required; instead, all the piping is sloped to cause water to drain back to the tank. The tank is not pressurized and operates at atmospheric pressure. As soon as the pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty before freezing can occur.
                    How a solar hot water system works
                    Residential solar thermal installations fall into two groups: passive (sometimes called "compact") and active (sometimes called "pumped") systems. Both typically include an auxiliary energy source (electric heating element or connection to a gas or fuel oil central heating system) that is activated when the water in the tank falls below a minimum temperature setting, ensuring that hot water is always available. The combination of solar water heating and back-up heat from a wood stove chimney[17] can enable a hot water system to work all year round in cooler climates, without the supplemental heat requirement of a solar water heating system being met with fossil fuels or electricity.
                    When a solar water heating and hot-water central heating system are used together, solar heat will either be concentrated in a pre-heating tank that feeds into the tank heated by the central heating, or the solar heat exchanger will replace the lower heating element and the upper element will remain to provide for supplemental heat. However, the primary need for central heating is at night and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than central heating because supply and demand are better matched. In many climates, a solar hot water system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. This can include domestic non-electric concentrating solar thermal systems. In many northern European countries, combined hot water and space heating systems (solar combisystems) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy. When combined with storage, large scale solar heating can provide 50-97% of annual heat consumption for district heating.

                    An integrated collector storage (ICS or batch heater) system uses a tank that acts as both storage and collector. Batch heaters are thin rectilinear tanks with a glass side facing the sun at noon. They are simple and less costly than plate and tube collectors, but they may require bracing if installed on a roof (to support 400–700 lb (180–320 kg) lbs of water), suffer from significant heat loss at night since the side facing the sun is largely uninsulated and are only suitable in moderate climates.
                    A convection heat storage unit (CHS) system is similar to an ICS system, except the storage tank and collector are physically separated and transfer between the two is driven by convection. CHS systems typically use standard flat-plate type or evacuated tube collectors. The storage tank must be located above the collectors for convection to work properly. The main benefit of CHS systems over ICS systems is that heat loss is largely avoided since the storage tank can be fully insulated. Since the panels are located below the storage tank, heat loss does not cause convection, as the cold water stays at the lowest part of the system.

                    Though effective at preventing freeze damage, antifreeze systems have drawbacks:

                      A drainback system is an active indirect system where the HTF (usually pure water) circulates through the collector, driven by a pump. The collector piping is not pressurized and includes an open drainback reservoir that is contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space. The HTF remains in the drainback reseervoir unless the pump is operating and returns there (emptying the collector) when the pump is switched off. The collector system, including piping, must drain via gravity into the drainback tank. Drainback systems are not subject to freezing or overheating. The pump operates only when appropriate for heat collection, but not to protect the HTF, increasing efficiency and reducing pumping costs.

                    <div class="listing">
                    <ul>
                      <li>  1. Any hot object ultimately returns to thermal equilibrium with its environment, due to heat loss from conduction, convection and radiation. Efficiency (the proportion of heat energy retained for a predefined time period) is directly related to heat loss from the collector surface. Convection and radiation are the most important sources of heat loss. Thermal insulation is used to slow heat loss from a hot object. This follows the Second law of thermodynamics (the 'equilibrium effect').</li>

                        <li>2. Heat is lost more rapidly if the temperature difference between a hot object and its environment is larger. Heat loss is predominantly governed by the thermal gradient between the collector surface and the ambient temperatures. Conduction, convection and radiation all occur more rapidly over large thermal gradients (the delta-t effect).</li>

                      A drainback system is an active indirect system where the HTF (usually pure water) circulates through the collector, driven by a pump. The collector piping is not pressurized and includes an open drainback reservoir that is contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space. The HTF remains in the drainback reseervoir unless the pump is operating and returns there (emptying the collector) when the pump is switched off. The collector system, including piping, must drain via gravity into the drainback tank. Drainback systems are not subject to freezing or overheating. The pump operates only when appropriate for heat collection, but not to protect the HTF, increasing efficiency and reducing pumping costs.

                    <b class="doubleQuote">&ldquo;</b><b class="firstWord">Flat plate</b>
                    Flat plate collectors are an extension of the idea to place a collector in an 'oven'-like box with glass directly facing the Sun.[1] Most flat plate collectors have two horizontal pipes at the top and bottom, called headers, and many smaller vertical pipes connecting them, called risers. The risers are welded (or similarly connected) to thin absorber fins. Heat-transfer fluid (water or water/antifreeze mix) is pumped from the hot water storage tank or heat exchanger into the collectors' bottom header, and it travels up the risers, collecting heat from the absorber fins, and then exits the collector out of the top header. Serpentine flat plate collectors differ slightly from this "harp" design, and instead use a single pipe that travels up and down the collector. However, since they cannot be properly drained of water, serpentine flat plate collectors cannot be used in drainback systems.
                    The type of glass used in flat plate collectors is almost always low-iron, tempered glass. Such glass can withstand significant hail without breaking, which is one of the reasons that flat-plate collectors are considered the most durable collector type.
                    Unglazed or formed collectors are similar to flat-plate collectors, except they are not thermally insulated nor physically protected by a glass panel. Consequently, these types of collectors are much less efficient when water temperature exceeds ambient air temperatures. For pool heating applications, the water to be heated is often colder than the ambient roof temperature, at which point the lack of thermal insulation allows additional heat to be drawn from the surrounding environment.

                    <b class="doubleQuote">&ldquo;</b><b class="firstWord">Evacuated tube</b>
                    Evacuated tube collectors (ETC) are a way to reduce the heat loss,[1] inherent in flat plates. Since heat loss due to convection cannot cross a vacuum, it forms an efficient isolation mechanism to keep heat inside the collector pipes. Since two flat glass sheets are generally not strong enough to withstand a vacuum, the vacuum is created between two concentric tubes. Typically, the water piping in an ETC is therefore surrounded by two concentric tubes of glass separated by a vacuum that admits heat from the sun (to heat the pipe) but that limits heat loss. The inner tube is coated with a thermal absorber. Vacuum life varies from collector to collector, from 5 years to 15 years.
                    Flat plate collectors are generally more efficient than ETC in full sunshine conditions. However, the energy output of flat plate collectors is reduced slightly more than ETCs in cloudy or extremely cold conditions.[1] Most ETCs are made out of annealed glass, which is susceptible to hail, failing given roughly golf ball -sized particles. ETCs made from "coke glass," which has a green tint, are stronger and less likely to lose their vacuum, but efficiency is slightly reduced due to reduced transparency. ETCs can gather energy from the sun all day long at low angles due to their tubular shape.

                    One way to power an active system is via a photovoltaic (PV) panel. To ensure proper pump performance and longevity, the (DC) pump and PV panel must be suitably matched. Although a PV-powered pump does not operate at night, the controller must ensure that the pump does not operate when the sun is out but the collector water is not hot enough.
                    PV pumps offer the following advantages:

                    A bubble pump (also known as geyser pump) is suitable for flat panel as well as vacuum tube systems. In a bubble pump system, the closed HTF circuit is under reduced pressure, which causes the liquid to boil at low temperature as the sun heats it. The steam bubbles form a geyser, causing an upward flow. The bubbles are separated from the hot fluid and condensed at the highest point in the circuit, after which the fluid flows downward toward the heat exchanger caused by the difference in fluid levels. The HTF typically arrives at the heat exchanger at 70 °C and returns to the circulating pump at 50 °C. Pumping typically starts at about 50 °C and increases as the sun rises until equilibrium is reached.

                    A differential controller senses temperature differences between water leaving the solar collector and the water in the storage tank near the heat exchanger. The controller starts the pump when the water in the collector is sufficiently about 8–10 °C warmer than the water in the tank, and stops it when the temperature difference reaches 3–5 °C. This ensures that stored water always gains heat when the pump operates and prevents the pump from excessive cycling on and off. (In direct systems the pump can be triggered with a difference around 4 °C because they have no heat exchanger.)

                    The simplest collector is a water-filled metal tank in a sunny place. The sun heats the tank. This was how the first systems worked. This setup would be inefficient due to the equilibrium effect: as soon as heating of the tank and water begins, the heat gained is lost to the environment and this continues until the water in the tank reaches ambient temperature. The challenge is to limit the heat loss.

                    ICS or batch collectors reduce heat loss by thermally insulating the tank. This is achieved by encasing the tank in a glass-topped box that allows heat from the sun to reach the water tank. The other walls of the box are thermally insulated, reducing convection and radiation. The box can also have a reflective surface on the inside. This reflects heat lost from the tank back towards the tank. In a simple way one could consider an ICS solar water heater as a water tank that has been enclosed in a type of 'oven' that retains heat from the sun as well as heat of the water in the tank. Using a box does not eliminate heat loss from the tank to the environment, but it largely reduces this loss.
                    Standard ICS collectors have a characteristic that strongly limits the efficiency of the collector: a small surface-to-volume ratio. Since the amount of heat that a tank can absorb from the sun is largely dependent on the surface of the tank directly exposed to the sun, it follows that the surface size defines the degree to which the water can be heated by the sun. Cylindrical objects such as the tank in an ICS collector have an inherently small surface-to-volume ratio. Collectors attempt to increase this ratio for efficient warming of the water. Variations on this basic design include collectors that combine smaller water containers and evacuated glass tube technology, a type of ICS system known as an Evacuated Tube Batch (ETB) collector.

                    ETSCs can be more useful than other solar collectors during winter season. ETCs can be used for heating and cooling purposes in industries like pharmaceutical and drug, paper, leather and textile and also for residential houses, hospitals, nursing home, hotels, swimming pool etc.
                    An ETC can operate at a range of temperatures from medium to high for solar hot water, swimming pool, air conditioning and solar cooker.
                    ETCs higher operational temperature range (up to 200 °C (392 °F)) makes them suitable for industrial applications such as steam generation, heat engine and solar drying.

                    Floating pool covering systems and separate STCs are used for pool heating.
                    Pool covering systems, whether solid sheets or floating disks, act as insulation and reduce heat loss. Much heat loss occurs through evaporation, and using a cover slows evaporation.
                    STCs for nonpotable pool water use are often made of plastic. Pool water is mildly corrosive due to chlorine. Water is circulated through the panels using the existing pool filter or supplemental pump. In mild environments, unglazed plastic collectors are more efficient as a direct system. In cold or windy environments evacuated tubes or flat plates in an indirect configuration are used in conjunction with a heat exchanger. This reduces corrosion. A fairly simple differential temperature controller is used to direct the water to the panels or heat exchanger either by turning a valve or operating the pump. Once the pool water has reached the required temperature, a diverter valve is used to return water directly to the pool without heating. Many systems are configured as drainback systems where the water drains into the pool when the water pump is switched off.
                    The collector panels are usually mounted on a nearby roof, or ground-mounted on a tilted rack. Due to the low temperature difference between the air and the water, the panels are often formed collectors or unglazed flat plate collectors. A simple rule-of-thumb for the required panel area needed is 50% of the pool's surface area. This is for areas where pools are used in the summer season only. Adding solar collectors to a conventional outdoor pool, in a cold climate, can typically extend the pool's comfortable usage by months and more if an insulating pool cover is used.[26] When sized at 100% coverage most solar hot water systems are capable of heating a pool anywhere from as little as 4 °C for a wind-exposed pool, to as much as 10 °C for a wind-sheltered pool covered consistently with a solar pool blanket.
                    An active solar energy system analysis program may be used to optimize the solar pool heating system before it is built.
